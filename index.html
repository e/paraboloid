<h1>Marcos Bartolom√©</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Engineer, GNU/Linux systems passionate, Python programmer, Perl, C and Assembly hobbyist</i></p>
<div style="margin: 40px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
	<p>I've worked as a programmer in many different environments. Lately I'm devoted to web development and ethical hacking. 
	I have been coding Django projects for more than four years, and I enjoy it a lot! 
	Here I explain my experience. Currently I am located in Madrid.

	<h2>Experience</h2>
	

	<h3>Freelancer</h3>
	<p><b>FARPE</b> - I have written and maintain farpe.org, the free market for handmade stuff.</p>
	<p><b>AESDO</b> - I have written aesdo.es, the website for the Spanish Association of Conductors.</p>
	<h3>Entelgy Consulting, S.A. (Free Software Department)</h3>
	<p>I have been involved in multiple projects, including bbvaopenmind.com, bbvafamilywealth.com 
	(you would need a password to see this one), and some invoice and human resources intranet applications.</p>

	<h3>Flumotion Services, S.A. (Development Team)</h3>
	<p>I have been working as a python programmer in the Flumotion open source streaming platform, and writing the backoffice 
	for their commercial products. I can help you to develop and deploy a streaming platform if you want videos in your 
	website and you want to host them yourself.</p>

	<h3>EADS CASA, Military Air Systems (Customer Support. Technical Publications & IPD Data. Eurofighter european program)</h3>
	<p>Here I have been working many years. I have helped to write the technical documentation for the aircraft (Aircraft 
	Maintenance Manual, Illustrated Parts Data, Wiring Diagrams...), and I have 
	written different tools to gather, improve and manage all that documentation. These are some of the tasks performed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Responsible for the reception and management of the client requirements (TPIRFs)</li>
		<li>Responsible for the adaptation of the publications produced by other EPCs to meet the client requirements</li>
		<li>Design, creation and maintenance of data bases and web applications (Python, Django, Perl) for the management of technical documentation for Eurofighter and Atlante projects.</li>
		<li>Design, creation and maintenance of data bases and web applications (Python, Django, Perl) for the generation of wiring diagrams and its inclusion in the interactive electronic technical publications (IETP)</li>
		<li>Analysis of client suggestions and proposals to improve technical publications</li>
		<li>Design, creation and maintenance of the processes involved in the nationalization of the technical publications</li>
		<li>Integration with the rest of the departments including Customer Support, Systems, Engineering, Production and Programs</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>ITP SA (Customer Support. Technical Publications & IPD Data. EUROJET european consortium)</h3>
	<p>This is the company that manufactures the Eurofighter jet engine for Spain, which is called Eurojet EJ200. I also helped to 
	write the documentation for the engine, which is separated from the aircraft documentation, and developed several tools to gather, 
	improve and manage all that documentation. These are some of the tasks performed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Technical Author. Technical writing, data modules revision and updating for EJ200 project (AECMA S1000D)</li>
		<li>Design, creation and maintenance of the processes involved in the nationalization of the technical publications</li>
		<li>Design, creation and maintenance of data bases and web applications (Perl) for the generation of the interactive electronic technical publications (IETP)</li>
		<li>System description, functional tests, installations, removals and inspections</li>
		<li>Maintenance and optimization of the processes to integrate the information in the IETP</li>
		<li>Verification of the integrity and functioning of the manuals delivered to the client</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>EADS CASA. Military Transport Aircraft Division</h3>
	<p>Technical publications. Similar to the above tasks, but with transport aircrafts rather than fighters (namely C212, CN235 and C295 projects - ATA100).</p>

	<h2>Additional information</h2>
	<p>Besides hacking, I am interested in energy production, electricity, electronics, and thermal engines. 
	I host here a method to build paraboloids with sheets of paper. If you stick an aluminium foil to the paper, 
	you can use this to build a parabolic solar concentrator and get heat, or an antenna and increase your signal.
	You just need to print a diagram and cut a paper following the lines and use some glue. 
	To draw that diagram, an integral calculus is needed, 
	but <a href="paraboloid">this site</a> takes care of that for you.</p>
